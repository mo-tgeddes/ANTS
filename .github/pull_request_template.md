### Testing

For core ANTS only tests, the bare minimum that will be accepted is the `group=unittests` but many, if not most, changes will need to test other groups to ensure they meet reviewer expectations. In general, it should be possible and is advised to run the `group=all` group prior to review submission as this will catch any consequential issues. **Additionally** you **must** run the `ancillary-file-science` tests, pointing at your branch, with `group=all` to capture any behaviour changes affecting Science codes.

If your change will alter existing science results, you will need to seek appropriate Scientific validation and confirm that the model has been initialised with your new development. Inspecting a change in xconv/pyplot/visualiser of choice is not sufficient to demonstrate the model can be initialised from your file.

**Impact of change**

- [ ] This will maintain results for ANTS `cylc vip ./rose-stem -z group=all` tests
- [ ] This will this maintain results for ancillary-file-science `cylc vip ./rose-stem -z group=all` tests
- [ ] If this change adds a new capability, evidence has been supplied to show testing of ancillary generation across different resolutions e.g. For global ancillary generation capabilities for use in NWP n1280e is expected to have been tested
- [ ] This change has significantly impacted required resources (runtime and memory) in existing ancillary generation (if yes, give details)
- [ ] This change alters existing ancils

**Approvals for this change**

- [ ] I have approval from the ANTS core development team for these changes

------

**New functionality further testing**

- [ ] If adding new functionality to existing codes, I confirm that the new code doesn't change results when it is switched off and ''works'' when switched on
- [ ] Unittests have been added
- [ ] Rose stem tests have been added for any new functionality
- [ ] If adding new functionality please confirm that the new code compares across different standard decompositions.
- [ ] I have not encountered any failures in my rose-stem output(s) <br>These tasks **must** succeed for your ticket to pass review.
- [ ] I have remembered to run the code style check tasks/tools
