What is ANTS?
=============

``ANTS`` is a Python library that provides interfaces and routines for
carrying out common operations needed to produce |ancillary files|. It is
built on top of |Iris| and uses |Mule| to write |Unified Model| (UM) ancillary
files.

In addition, some standard applications are provided to support:

 * regridding of data
 * filling data
 * merging datasets
 * converting files to ancillary file format
 * generation of |polygon files| that may be needed for ancillary generation

What is ANTS not?
=================

While ``ANTS`` provides a library for carrying out common operations needed
for ancillary generation, it is:

 * not where ancillary science routines live
 * not where ancillary generation workflows live
 * not the library for generation of Unstructured Grid ancillaries


Related areas
=============

When carrying out work generating or writing new ancillary generation code, a
number of areas beyond the ``ANTS`` library itself will likely be encountered.

.. _ancillary_file_science_introduction:

Ancillary-file-science
----------------------

The ``ancillary-file-science`` repository is a central location for the
lodging of ANTS based ancillary science routines. The codes in there are owned
by scientists, with technical advice and assurance provided by the ``ANTS``
developers. A |rose stem| workflow exists in ``ancillary-file-science`` to
enable routine testing of the ancillary science routines lodged there - known
as "Apps" - as updates are made to the ``ANTS`` library.

.. _Datasets_introduction:

Datasets
--------

In order to generate an ancillary file, you will normally need some input data
which is then passed to an ancillary science routine to produce the required
outputs. Such datasets - commonly refered to as "master files" - may come in a
variety of formats, from a range of different sources, with differing
structures even for the same sort of input domain. As such, some
"pre-processing" will typically be required in order to get the source dataset
in an appropriate state for use by the ancillary science routines it is to be
processed by. It is likely that when using a new dataset you will need to
write a new "pre-processor" for it. You will want to refer to the relevant
``ancillary-file-science`` App to understand what is needed and there may be
related pre-processors available that you could use as starting points.

Ideally, files input into ancillary science routines should be in |netCDF|
format as ``ANTS`` (and Iris) is well optimised for working with this
format. It also has the added benefit of allowing metadata to be recorded with
the data itself - allowing capture of provenance, licensing, and distribution
information.

.. _Workflows_introduction:

Ancillary Workflows
-------------------

Ancillary Workflows are |cylc| based workflows (suites) that are owned,
maintained, and developed by science teams and are not maintained by the
``ANTS`` developers. These workflows will often include one or more jobs
running ``ancillary-file-science`` Apps to process "Master Files" into
ancillary files, and are the typical entry point for someone wanting to
produce a new ancillary file rather than the ``ANTS`` library itself. Examples
of these are the Global Atmosphere (GA), Regional Atmosphere (RA), and |JULES|
suites.

The CAP
-------

The CAP was a Fortran based libary previously used to generate Unified Model
ancillary files. It is, however, long since unmaintained and unsupported. Much
work has been put into providing ``ancillary-file-science`` implementation of
equivalent, or newer, science to enable migration away from the CAP to
``ANTS`` based ``ancillary-file-science`` implementations.

UG-ANTS / UG-Ancillary-file-science
-----------------------------------

With the move to |LFRic|, our models move to using a |cubesphere| grid and it
becomes necessary to have tooling and write new science routines to support
the new grid and model requirements. ``ANTS`` does not support generation of
the unstructured grid ancillary files needed for this. Instead, a separate
``UG-ANTS`` and associated ``ug-ancillary-file-science`` are being
developed. Due to the various complexities both in terms of implementations
needed, along with the structure of the existing ``ANTS`` and
``ancillary-file-science`` codes, an active decision was made to develop these
as distinct, separate things. These libraries follow the same principles as
regular ``ANTS`` and ``ancillary-file-science`` - ``UG-ANTS`` is the
underpinning Python library, and ``ug-ancillary-file-science`` is where
ancillary science routines for generating UGrid ancillary files live.
