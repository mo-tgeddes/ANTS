=============================
Ancillary Generation Pipeline
=============================

The generation of an ancillary file is usually carried out by one or more
:ref:`ancillary_file_science_introduction` scripts, as run by one or more
tasks within :ref:`Workflows_introduction`.

          source file on its native grid, regridding to a target grid,
          processing on the new grid, and saving to an ancillary file.

Regardless of how the code itself is divided up into different scripts in
:ref:`ancillary_file_science_introduction`, a typical ANTS based ancillary
generation pipeline will usually consist of the following key stages:

Load Master File
----------------

To get started generating an ancillary file, the first thing you will need to
do is load a source dataset, referred to as "Master File". Ideally this will
be a |netCDF file|, but typically anything |Iris| can load can be loaded at this
point. Other source formats may be supported via either specific ANTS routines
or by other python libraries present in the environment.

Source Grid Processing
----------------------

If the source data is not already in the form of an Iris cube at this point,
you will want to write a routine to convert it to one.

With the source data loaded in, at this point any source specific processing
can be carried out. This might be metadata correction, selecting some subset of
the source, or (more generally) "fixing" any problems with the source data.
Typically this will take the form of Python code using Iris operations to
work with data stored in Iris cubes.

In the case where the source grid processing is carried out in the pipeline as
a distinct script, the application implementing that script is sometimes
referred to as a "pre-processor".

Regrid
------

Once any source grid specific processing has been carried out, the next step is
to regrid the data to the target model grid. This can be carried out either by
using the standalone :mod:`ants.cli.ancil_general_regrid` application or calling the
appropriate :mod:`ants.regrid` routine.

Model Grid Processing
---------------------

With the data now on the model grid, at the target resolution, any grid
specific operations can now be carried out. These might be filtering
operations, generating derivative data fields, mappings, etc. This will take
the form of Python code operating on Iris cubes. This code might use generic
operations available via the ANTS library or more specific science routines
implemented in :ref:`ancillary_file_science_introduction`. At the end of this
step, all science operations should have been applied, required metadata set,
and all required data generated ready for saving.

Save to Ancillary File Format
-----------------------------

The final step is to save the processed data to the ancillary file format
appropriate for the model you are running, using the relevant saver routine
from the :mod:`ants.io.save` module.

Recommendations
===============

When writing the code going into your ancillary generation pipeline we make the
following recommendations:

* Work with netCDF files throughout the pipeline up until the final saving of
  the model ancillary file.
* Do check the :doc:`API docs <lib/modules>` to see if there is an existing
  ANTS routine that will carry out the operations you need.
* Do try and split your code up into the distinct steps above where possible -
  monolithic scripts covering multiple steps can be hard to debug and
  expensive to keep re-running should problems occur during the execution of
  the script.
* While the decomposition framework can be useful for supporting scalability
  of operations in a pipeline, it should be used sparingly. Only use it where
  you need to!
