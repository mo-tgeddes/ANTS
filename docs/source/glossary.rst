    ancillary files
      Ancillary files are the mechanism by which external data sources are entered into weather, climate, and land surface models.
      This includes model orography, soil and vegetation types, climatologies for sea surface temperature and sea ice.

    binary operation
      A function that takes in two arguments.

    contrib
      The legacy name for the `ancillary-file-science`_ repository (link requires being logged in to a GitHub account with appropriate permissions).  This repository contains the applications for generating the ancillary files for a variety of Momentum model configurations.

    cubesphere
      An unstructured mesh alternate to the traditional lat-lon grid.

    cylc
      Cylc ("silk") is a workflow engine for cycling systems. See the `Cylc Documentation`_.

    Iris
      A Python package for analysing and visualising Earth science data. See the `Iris Documentation`_.

    JULES
      Joint UK Land Environment Simulator. See the `JULES trac page`_.

    LFRic
      Met Office's combined weather and climate forecasting next generation model. See the `LFRic trac page`_.

    Mule
      A Python API which allows you to access and manipulate files produced by the |UM|. See the `Mule Documentation`_.

    NetCDF
      NetCDF (Network Common Data Form) is a set of software libraries and machine-independent
      data formats that support the creation, access, and sharing of array-oriented scientific data. See the `NetCDF Documentation`_.

    polygon files
      A file that defines a region, see the `Shapely Documentation`_.

    rose stem
      Rose Stem is a testing system for use with Rose. It provides a user-friendly way of defining source trees and tasks on the
      command line which are then passed by Rose Stem to the suite as Jinja2 variables. See the `Rose Stem Documentation`_.
      ANTS previously made use of the rose stem system for functional testing,
      but from v3.0, the workflow is run via the ``cylc vip`` command, rather
      than using ``rose stem``.

    unary operation
      A function that takes in only one argument.

    Unified Model
      Met Office's combined weather and climate forecasting operational model. See the `UM GitHub repository`_.
